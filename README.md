### My First Project with JavaScript

This project aims to create and validate a password on the same page, so the user does not need to navigate between pages to generate or validate a password. Everything can be done on the same site.

- **Password Generator:** The goal is simpleâ€”generate a password based on the user's selected criteria. The user can choose the desired password length and whether it should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. When clicking the button to generate a password, it will be created according to the selected criteria.

- **Password Validator:** To ensure the password is valid and has a good security level, the user must enter a password and check whether it is classified as weak, medium, or strong.
